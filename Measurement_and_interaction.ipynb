We have a screen with two slits A and B, and a photographic plate located behind the screen (and positioned parallel to the screen). An electron cannon is shooting an electron beam directed at the screen. For simplicity we suppose that each electron is prepared in an identical initial state, and travels with the momentum $p$ directed towards the screen."

The role of the screen (for the purpose of the double-slit experiment) is to essentially impose the boundary conditions on the electron wave function right behind the screen. Such boundary conditions can be interpreted as having two (small-sized) sources, located at the slits A and B. These are the sources of the electron wave behind the screen, which is essentially a quantum-mechanical manifestation of the [Huygens principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens–Fresnel_principle)."

The screen can be modeled by an infinite potential wall at all points except for the slits A and B so that electrons (which don't hit the slits) reflect from the wall (some electrons might also fly around the screen: we will neglect this small contribution to the superposition state of the electron).

Indeed, to detect which slit an electron went through it is enough to have just one detector. Let us keep the detector next to the slit A and remove the detector next to the slit B. If the electron hits the photographic plate behind the screen, i.e., if the electron actually went through one of the slits, we can detect which slit it went through using just the detector A. If the detector A triggered, then the electron went through the slit A. If the detector A *did not* trigger, yet the electron hit the photographic plate, then the electron went through B.

It is not necessary to have a conscious observer in the lab who will actually do the logical deduction, yet the possibility to make those logical deductions *in principle* is enough to ensure that the wave function collapses.

        "Of course, if two (or more) observers meet and discuss their individual measurements of the system, their results should agree, as in the EPR experiment, and the double-slit experiment discussed above. Such an agreement represents one of the experimentally-verifiable tests of quantum mechanics. However, before the measurement of the state of the system, one cannot experimentally verify which state the system was in, and therefore tautologically one cannot do experimental check before the experiment! The whole discussion of the \"problem\" of \"when\" the collapse of the wave function has \"really\" occurred is therefore ill-formulated and vacuous! The correct way of talking about the collapse of the wave function is in the ordinal sense of the updated knowledge, rather than the cardinal sense of the dynamical event occurring at the specific moment in time."
