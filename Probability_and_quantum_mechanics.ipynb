In particular, the misunderstanding of probability theory is frequently manifested in the belief that the concept of probability used in quantum mechanics is somehow different from the concept of probability used in other branches of physics and mathematics. However, this is impossible: in mathematics and physics correct theories are either unique or dual (equivalent) to each other, and it is impossible to have any plurality of mutually-exclusive interpretations of mathematically or physically precise statements and theories."

At the risk of repeating once again the very important message of the previous paragraph it is worth emphasizing that one should make sure to first of all get comfortable with concepts of the probability theory before attempting to understand quantum mechanics. This is because quantum mechanics is essentially and fundamentally a probabilistic theory, and it uses exactly the same concepts of probability as the classic probability theory. One does not have a separate probability theory specifically for quantum mechanics: there is just one probability theory."

Absolutely no! In both cases, we have the same probability theory, which supplies us with the unique and universal way to reason about the events under the conditions of uncertainty. Uncertainty remains an uncertainty, and the way we make judgments about it remains the same regardless of whether that uncertainty bears a fundamental character (as in quantum mechanics) or is \"simply\" emergent due to practical difficulties which we would have encountered while attempting to solve the deterministic equations describing dynamics of the system (as in the classical statistical physics, gambling, etc.)**"

Such an average color is an observable analogous to the frequency of drawing the red ball.

A specific example of an erroneous thinking is given by an implicit or explicit assumption that the wave function possesses an \"observable physical meaning\" and exists objectively. Since the wave function is essentially (a complex-valued and dynamical wave of) probability the erroneous statements about the observable nature of the wave function originate from the erroneous opinions about the observable nature of the probability. One of the consequences of such a fallacious thinking is given by the assertion that the collapse of the wave function is a problematic feature of quantum mechanics which needs an explanation in terms of some \"more fundamental underlying dynamics\" (which is known as the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem)). **In reality, however, the wave function is not an observable, and its collapse, in particular, is not observable.**"

Yet due to performing Bayesian inferences after 1000 observations, there is a clear peak around $p=0.75$. The observable frequency of a red ball (i.e., the average color) is ${\\cal C} = 0.75$ in agreement with its prediction using the Bayes theorem (although this 'prediction' was made for the training set it will be accurate on the test set as well). Notice how the logical arrow of inference is *probability*$\\rightarrow$*frequency*, not vice versa!"

On the most fundamental level, the state of a physical system is encoded in the state vector in the Hilbert space, and any physical dynamics is determined by the Hamiltonian of the system and is described by the evolution of this state (wave function or density matrix) according to the Schrodinger's or the von Neumann's equation."

The non-trivial breakthrough made by Bohr and Heisenberg was the realization that on the fundamental level all observable properties of physical systems are encoded in a non-observable wave function. At the same time, quantum mechanics supplies us with the precise prescription of how the wave function is to be used to derive observable quantities."

Any observation of ${\\cal C}$ always yields either one of these two eigenvalues. As it was emphasized by [Heisenberg](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-Philosophy-Revolution-Modern-Science/dp/0061209198/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=heisenberg+physics+and+philosophy&qid=1595342381&sr=8-1\") one of the essential physical cornerstones of quantum mechanics is given by the insistent emphasis on making physical predictions only about *physically observable quantities*."

        "That is, while on the most fundamental level one can encode the whole state of the system and all of its dynamics in the wave function and its unitary evolution, the physical predictions of quantum mechanics are concerned with the observables expressed in terms of the corresponding hermitian operators. At the same time, the wave function itself is not an observable, and quantum mechanics is not concerned with endowing the wave function with any sort of an observable physical meaning. Instead, quantum mechanics deals with quantities such as expectation values of observables such as ${\\cal C}$, which are written down in terms of the matrix elements (in the corresponding representation, or a basis) such as $\\langle \\psi| {\\cal C}|\\psi\\rangle$."

It turns out that an individual measurement of an observable corresponding to the operator ${\\cal C}$ results in *random* outcomes (in general, we need a repeated experiment performed on systems prepared in identical initial states because the measured operator in the given system will remain to be in the state we found it in). For instance, the Geiger counter will randomly detect events of radioactive decay in accordance with the Poisson distribution, which indicates an exponential distribution describing the underlying probability of the decay of each individual radioactive (unstable) nucleus. This probability is encoded in the quantum state of the system."

For instance, the relativity theory replaced the Newtonian mechanics as it proved to be more accurate in describing the behavior of systems at large velocities and in a strong gravitational field. String theory in turn (and in particular) generalized general relativity since it extended Einstein's theory of gravitation to the high energies of Planck's scale where quantum effects of gravity can no longer be neglected. (There are no observations at the Planck's scale, but we know that the general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are experimentally successful at energies well below the Planck's scale, have to be reconciled theoretically at high energies.) However, there is *no* analogous crisis in quantum mechanics which would require us to revise its foundations and/or construct a more full or a \"more fundamental\" theory.
